🛠️ Tools & MethodologyPrimary Tool: Google Sheets (Advanced)Techniques Used:Data Cleaning: Handling missing values (IFERROR, FILTER), sanitizing text (PROPER, TRIM), and duplicate removal.Feature Engineering:Lifecycle Status: Created logic to distinguish "New" vs. "Existing" customers.Financial Health: Segmented users into "In Debt" vs. "In Credit" based on balance sheets.Analysis: Pivot Tables, Correlation Matrices, and Descriptive Statistics.Visualization: Interactive Dashboard with Slicers and Dynamic Charts.📊 Key Insights & Findings1. The "Solvency" CorrelationCustomers with a Personal Loan are 3x less likely to subscribe to a term deposit.Action: Exclude leads with loan = yes from cold-call lists immediately.2. Seasonal InefficiencyMay is the highest volume month (31% of calls) but has the lowest efficiency (6% conversion). In contrast, October and September show conversion rates >15%.Action: Shift 20% of the marketing budget from Q2 (May) to Q3/Q4 (Sep-Oct).3. Demographic Opportunities"The Golden Ratio": Students (<25) and Retirees (>60) convert at 25%+, yet make up less than 5% of the call volume."The Blue-Collar Trap": Blue-collar workers receive the most calls but have the lowest ROI.4. Duration ThresholdsCalls exceeding 15 minutes (900s) have a diminishing return on investment and often indicate non-sales interactions (complaints).Action: Implement a soft operational cap at 12 minutes to preserve agent availability.💡 Strategic RecommendationsRecommendationPriorityFeasibilityEst.
